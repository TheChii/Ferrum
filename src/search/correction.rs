//! Correction history for evaluation adjustment.

//! Tracks the difference between static evaluation and search scores

//! When static eval is consistently higher than search score for a pawn structure,
//! the correction becomes negative (reduces eval). When static eval is consistently
//! lower, the correction becomes positive (increases eval).
